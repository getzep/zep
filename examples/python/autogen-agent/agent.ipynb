    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "- Create an Autogen Agent class that extends `ConversableAgent` by adding long-term memory\n",
    "- Create a Mental Health Assistant Agent, CareBot, that acts as a counselor and coach.\n",
    "- Create a user Agent, Cathy, who stands in for our expected user.\n",
    "- Demonstrate preloading chat history into Zep.\n",
    "- Demonstrate the agents in conversation, with CareBot recalling facts from previous conversations with Cathy.\n",
    "- Inspect Facts within Zep, and demonstrate how to use Zep's Fact Ratings to improve the quality of returned facts.\n"
