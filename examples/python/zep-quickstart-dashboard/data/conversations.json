      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome! I'd love to help you find the perfect home for your family. Let me ask a few questions to understand what you're looking for."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Great! We're looking for something with at least 3 bedrooms, ideally 4 if we can find it, since we need space for both kids and a home office."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "That makes sense. What's your budget range for this purchase?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "We're looking to stay between $200,000 and $400,000. We can stretch up to maybe $420,000 for the right place."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect. That gives us good options in several neighborhoods. What areas are you interested in?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "We'd prefer to stay in the Westside or near good schools. Our oldest starts middle school next year."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent. Schools are definitely a priority. What about outdoor space? Do you need a backyard?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, a backyard is essential. The kids need space to play, and we love to host family barbecues in the summer."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll start looking for 3-4 bedroom homes with good yards in family-friendly neighborhoods with top-rated schools. I'll send you some listings this week."}

      {"role": "user", "content": "I looked at those listings you sent. The one on Maple Street looks interesting!"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Maple Street property is lovely! It has 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and a great backyard. Would you like to schedule a showing?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, please! Can we see it this Saturday? My husband will be available then."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Saturday works perfectly. I've scheduled a showing for 10am. The house also has an updated kitchen which I think you'll love."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "That's great! One thing though - is there parking? We have two cars."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, it has a 2-car garage plus driveway space. Plenty of room for both vehicles."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Perfect. Are there any other similar properties we should look at while we're out?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "I found two more in your price range nearby. One on Oak Drive with 5 bedrooms, and another on Pine Avenue with a larger lot."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "The 4-bedroom sounds interesting. We could use the extra room for guests since my parents visit often."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll add the Oak Drive property to your Saturday tour. It's listed at $385,000 and has been on the market for just two weeks."}

      {"role": "user", "content": "We saw both houses yesterday. The Maple Street one was nice but felt a bit cramped, and honestly it only has 2 bathrooms which might not be enough."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand. What did you think of the Oak Drive property with 4 bedrooms?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "We loved the space! But honestly, it needs too much work. The kitchen is really outdated and we don't want a major renovation."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's valuable feedback. So move-in ready or recently updated is important to you?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Exactly. We want something we can move into without major projects. Maybe cosmetic updates are fine, but no gut renovations."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it. Let me focus on homes that have been updated in the last 5-10 years. Any other must-haves we should add to the criteria?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "A good-sized master bedroom would be great. And if it has hardwood floors, even better!"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Noted! Hardwood floors are popular in this area. What about a home office space - still important?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, very important. My husband works from home three days a week, so we need a dedicated office with a door. Also, I'm thinking at least 2.5 bathrooms would be ideal with the kids getting older."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect. I'll search for move-in ready, 3-4 bedroom homes with at least 2.5 baths, hardwood floors, updated features, good yards, and space for a home office. I'll have new options for you by Wednesday."}

      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Birch Lane house is stunning! It's listed at $365,000, has beautiful hardwood floors throughout, and was renovated in 2021. I can get you in Thursday at 5pm."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Thursday works! What's the school district for that property?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's in the Riverside School District - highly rated. The elementary school is actually walkable, just 3 blocks away."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "That's perfect! Our daughter could walk to school. What about the backyard size?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The lot is 0.3 acres with a fully fenced backyard. There's a patio area and plenty of grass for the kids to play."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Sounds ideal. Is there central AC? That's something we realized we need after looking at the Oak Drive house."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, it has central air and heat, both updated in 2021 during the renovation. Very energy efficient."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Great. And the garage situation?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "2-car attached garage with additional storage space. There's also a workshop area that your husband might appreciate."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "He'll love that! We're really excited to see this one. It checks all our boxes."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have a good feeling about this property for you! See you Thursday at 5pm."}

      {"role": "user", "content": "What do you think we should offer? It's listed at $365,000."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on recent comps in the area, I'd recommend offering $375,000. It's a strong offer that shows you're serious without going too high."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "That's a bit of a stretch but within our budget. Should we include any contingencies?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Definitely include a home inspection contingency. I'd also recommend a financing contingency since you're getting a mortgage."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Good idea. We're pre-approved up to $420,000, so financing shouldn't be an issue."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect. That strengthens your position. How about the closing timeline - do you have flexibility?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Our lease ends in 60 days, so we could close anytime in the next 45-60 days."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's ideal. Most sellers appreciate a flexible buyer. Let me draft the offer with $375,000, standard contingencies, and a 45-day close. We can present it this evening."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Let's do it! My husband and I are both so excited. This house has everything we wanted - the yard, the office, the updated kitchen, the school district, and 2.5 bathrooms."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "It really does check every box! I'll get the paperwork ready and call you within the hour. Fingers crossed!"}
