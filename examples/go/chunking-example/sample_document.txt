1. INTRODUCTION AND COMPANY VALUES
================================================================================

Welcome to ACME Corporation. This handbook outlines our policies, procedures, and expectations for all employees. Our company was founded in 2010 with a mission to deliver innovative solutions that transform how businesses operate. We are committed to fostering a workplace culture built on integrity, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

ACME Corporation's core values guide everything we do:

INNOVATION: We encourage creative thinking and embrace new ideas. Every employee is empowered to propose improvements to our products, processes, and workplace environment. Our annual Innovation Challenge awards cash prizes to the best employee-submitted ideas, with the top prize being $25,000.

INTEGRITY: We conduct all business with the highest ethical standards. This means being honest with customers, partners, and each other. Employees are expected to report any concerns about unethical behavior through our anonymous Ethics Hotline (1-800-ACME-ETH) or directly to the Chief Compliance Officer.

INCLUSION: We believe diverse perspectives lead to better outcomes. ACME is committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment. Our Diversity & Inclusion Council meets quarterly to review progress on our inclusion goals and recommend new initiatives.

IMPACT: We measure success not just by financial results but by the positive impact we have on our customers, communities, and the environment. Our annual Community Service Day provides all employees with paid time to volunteer at local organizations.

================================================================================
2. REMOTE WORK POLICY
================================================================================

Effective March 1, 2024, ACME Corporation has implemented a hybrid work model that balances flexibility with collaboration. This policy applies to all eligible employees whose roles can be performed remotely.

Full remote employees must maintain a dedicated home office space and be available during core business hours (9:00 AM - 3:00 PM in their local time zone).

Hybrid Schedule: Employees work a combination of remote and in-office days. The standard hybrid arrangement is three days remote and two days in-office per week. In-office days should be coordinated with your team to maximize collaboration opportunities.

Office-Based: Some roles require daily in-person presence. These positions include facilities staff, security personnel, laboratory technicians, and certain customer-facing roles. Office-based employees may request occasional remote work days with manager approval.

================================================================================
4. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
================================================================================

ACME Corporation invests in employee growth through various professional development programs. We believe that supporting your career development benefits both you and the company.

EDUCATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

The Education Assistance Program provides financial support for job-related education. Eligible expenses include:
- Tuition for degree programs at accredited institutions

To participate, employees must have completed one year of service and maintain satisfactory job performance. A commitment to remain employed for 12 months after completing funded coursework is required, or the benefit must be repaid on a prorated basis.

INTERNAL TRAINING PROGRAMS

ACME Learning offers over 500 online courses through our learning management system. Topics include:
- Technical skills (programming, data analysis, project management)
- Leadership development
- Communication and presentation skills
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion
- Compliance and ethics training

All employees have access to ACME Learning. Mandatory compliance training must be completed annually by December 31st. Managers should work with employees to identify relevant courses as part of career development planning.

MENTORSHIP PROGRAM

The ACME Mentorship Program pairs employees with experienced leaders for professional guidance. Mentorship relationships typically last 12 months and include:
- Monthly one-on-one meetings
- Goal setting and progress tracking
- Career path exploration
- Skill development activities

Applications for the mentorship program are accepted twice per year, in January and July. Contact the Talent Development team for more information.

INTERNAL MOBILITY

We encourage employees to explore career opportunities across the organization. Internal candidates receive priority consideration for open positions if they meet the minimum qualifications. To be eligible for internal transfer:
- You must have been in your current role for at least 12 months
- You must have no active performance improvement plans
- You must have manager approval to apply

================================================================================
5. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Our performance management process is designed to provide regular feedback, recognize achievements, and support professional growth. We use a continuous feedback model rather than relying solely on annual reviews.

PERFORMANCE CONVERSATIONS

Managers and employees should have ongoing performance conversations throughout the year. At minimum, formal check-ins should occur:
- Weekly: Brief status updates on current projects and any immediate support needs
- Monthly: Discussion of progress toward goals, feedback on recent work, and short-term priorities
- Quarterly: Comprehensive review of goal progress, skills development, and career aspirations

GOAL SETTING

All employees set annual goals aligned with departmental and company objectives. Goals should follow the SMART framework:
- Specific: Clearly defined outcomes
- Measurable: Quantifiable success criteria
- Achievable: Realistic given available resources
- Relevant: Connected to team and company priorities
- Time-bound: Clear deadlines and milestones

Employees typically have 4-6 goals per year. Goals are entered into the ACME Performance system by January 31st and may be adjusted mid-year with manager approval.

ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS

Formal performance reviews are conducted in December each year. The review process includes:
- Self-assessment by the employee
- Manager assessment with documentation
- Calibration sessions to ensure consistent ratings across teams
- One-on-one review meeting to discuss results
- Goal setting for the upcoming year

Performance ratings use a five-point scale:
5 - Exceptional: Consistently exceeds expectations with outstanding results
4 - Exceeds Expectations: Regularly performs above expected levels
3 - Meets Expectations: Consistently achieves expected performance levels
2 - Needs Improvement: Performance falls below expectations in some areas
1 - Unsatisfactory: Performance significantly below expectations

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS

If an employee receives a rating of 2 or below, they may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). A PIP is a formal document outlining:
- Specific performance deficiencies
- Clear expectations for improvement
- Support and resources available
- Timeline for improvement (typically 30-90 days)
- Consequences if improvement is not achieved

PIPs are intended to help employees succeed, not to punish. Employees on a PIP receive additional support including more frequent check-ins and access to coaching resources.

6. WORKPLACE CONDUCT AND ETHICS
================================================================================

ACME Corporation is committed to maintaining a professional, respectful, and ethical workplace. All employees are expected to uphold these standards.

- Outside employment with competitors or vendors
- Financial interests in companies that do business with ACME
- Personal relationships with subordinates or vendors

All potential conflicts must be disclosed to your manager and the Compliance team. The Compliance team will determine whether the conflict can be managed or must be eliminated.

================================================================================

Protecting company and customer information is everyone's responsibility. The following policies apply to all employees, contractors, and third parties with access to ACME systems.

DATA CLASSIFICATION

Company data is classified into four categories:
- Public: Information intended for public distribution
