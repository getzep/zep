If you prefer pure rock climbing, try Touchstone Wall (5.6) which is more beginner-friendly but still spectacular. For something in between, Space Shot (5.7 C2) is fantastic. All are multi-pitch as you requested. Make sure to get permits in advance and consider hiring a local guide for your first Zion big wall experience."

Zion Adventure Company also has quality rental gear and can connect you with certified guides. Both are right in Springdale. I'd recommend booking guide services in advance, especially for spring season. They can provide everything from single-pitch instruction to full big wall guiding, and they know the current route conditions better than anyone."

Rocky Mountain National Park offers similar convenience with trailheads right off the main roads, plus you get those dramatic alpine lakes and 14ers. The Maroon Bells area is more remote but absolutely stunning - those iconic peaks reflected in Maroon Lake are unforgettable. If you loved Boulder's mix of challenge and accessibility, I'd lean toward RMNP. You could base yourself in Estes Park in a cozy mountain lodge and have dozens of trails within 30 minutes."

Black Canyon Inn is another gem with rustic cabins and a great location. For something really special, consider the YMCA of the Rockies - they have individual cabins scattered through the forest that feel incredibly secluded while still being close to everything. All of these places capture that mountain cabin atmosphere you loved in Boulder."

This lets you afford those $200-300/night boutique places while still having plenty for guided adventures, special dining, or unexpected opportunities. The key is booking your must-have accommodation first, then building experiences around it."

You could also book unique transportation like scenic train rides or small plane tours. The beauty of this budget is you can mix 2-3 premium experiences rather than compromising on quality."

You'll also get better accommodation availability than fall. The potential downsides: some high-elevation trails might still have snow (especially above 10,000 feet), weather can be more unpredictable with spring storms, and rivers might be too high/cold for crossing. But honestly, these are minor compared to the benefits, and you can always plan alternate lower-elevation routes."

        "content": "May and early June are ideal! By May, most trails below 9,000 feet are clear, wildflowers are starting to bloom, and temperatures are perfect for hiking - usually 60-75°F during the day. Early June extends your options to higher elevations and peak wildflower season. April can still be iffy with lingering snow, while late June starts getting into summer heat and crowds. If you're flexible, aim for mid-May to early June - you'll hit that sweet spot of great weather, clear trails, and stunning spring scenery."
