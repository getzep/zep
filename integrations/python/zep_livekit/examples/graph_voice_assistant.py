"""
Graph Voice Assistant Example with Zep Memory

This example demonstrates how to create a knowledge-based voice assistant using
Zep's graph memory and LiveKit.

The agent stores conversations in a shared Zep knowledge graph for persistent
memory across sessions. Perfect for building AI assistants that can learn and
remember information from conversations.

Before running:
1. Install dependencies: pip install zep-livekit
2. Set environment variables:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key
   - ZEP_API_KEY: Your Zep Cloud API key

Usage:
    python graph_voice_assistant.py
