## What is Zep? ðŸ’¬

Zep is a memory platform for AI agents that learns from user interactions and business data. It builds a temporal knowledge graph to provide AI assistants with personalized, accurate, and up-to-date information, enhancing user experiences through continuous learning.

### How Zep works

1. Add chat messages or data artifacts to Zep during each user interaction or agent event
2. Zep intelligently integrates new information into the user's Knowledge Graph, updating existing context as needed
3. Retrieve relevant facts from Zep for subsequent interactions or events

Zep's temporal Knowledge Graph maintains contextual information about facts, enabling reasoning about state changes and providing data provenance insights.

## Graphiti: The Knowledge Graph Framework

Zep is powered by [Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti), an open-source temporal knowledge graph framework that we developed to handle changing relationships and maintain historical context.

What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph while reasoning about state changes over time. Each fact includes `valid_at` and `invalid_at` dates, allowing agents to track changes in user preferences, traits, or environment.

Visit the [Graphiti repository](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) to learn more about the knowledge graph framework that powers Zep's memory capabilities.

## Framework Integration

Zep is framework agnostic and works seamlessly with:

- LangChain
- LangGraph
- LlamaIndex
- Chainlit
- Microsoft Autogen
- And many more

## Community Edition (Legacy)

**Note**: Zep Community Edition is no longer supported and has been deprecated. The Community Edition code has been moved to the `legacy/` folder in this repository.

For current Zep development, we recommend using Zep Cloud or exploring the example projects in this repository.
